You might want to develop a custom audio client. These steps involve:

- [Setting up IAM authentication]({{site.baseurl}}/audio/audio_authentication) for your audio client. 
- [Establishing a web socket connection]({{site.baseurl}}/audio/audio_authentication#Establishing-a-web-socket-connection) to send audio from your custom client to the audio gateway.  
- Sending [audio streaming messages]({{site.baseurl}}/audio/interface) on the web socket connection.

**Important**: Use the sample Java-based audio client code as a reference to guide your development.
