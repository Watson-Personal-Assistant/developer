User input to Watson Assistant Solutions can be in text or audio form. Watson Assistant Solutions uses the conversation component to route requests to the skill that is best placed to handle each request.

After sending utterances to the conversation component, your application receives a JSON reply that includes, along with JSON context data, the textual reply for you to show or speak to your user.

The conversation REST API provides the following end points:
- Converse: send converse requests to a skill, a skillset, or all skills.  Typically, converse requests are sent to a skillset but in the proactive scenario, you might want a single skill to handle the userâ€™s response to a prompt from the assistant.
- Skills: register a skill with Watson Assistant Solutions.
- SkillSets: create, update, or delete skillsets for grouping skills.
- SkillSets-Skills Links: group skills into skillsets.
- Health: check the availability status of a skill or skillset.
