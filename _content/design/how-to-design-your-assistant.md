Assistants that are built with Watson Assistant Solutions are most impactful when they are designed to be personal, proactive, and portable.

Engagement with an AI assistant is inherently different than traditional mobile or web applications, especially if your assistant has a voice interface or a combination of text and voice. AI assistants should rely on contextual information and memory to maintain simplicity for the user.

AI assistants may come in all form factors and vary widely through the capabilities they offer. For a great experience, look to design fundamentals. The mantra for designers is _who, where, and wow_.  It involves understanding users, what they are trying to do, and how you can wow them.

#### Who: understand _who_ your users are
Think about your primary users (that is, personas). Who are they, are they business professionals, stay at home parents, students, the elderly? Do they have specific traits or interests that will help you better understand their needs?

Consider the “personality” of your assistant.  When speaking to a virtual assistant, users want to feel like they are speaking to another entity with a personality. Consider what personality is appropriate for the services you are offering. Personality is demonstrated in how the assistant responds and engages the user. For instance, a fitness assistant will use more active language and may crack the occasional joke, while an assistant that helps independent seniors at home may use more polite and passive language to be less intrusive.

#### What: understand _what_ your users do to meet their needs
Think about the purpose of your assistant. Are you trying to resolve an existing problem or irritation, streamline a cumbersome process, or save users money or time? What will your app do that no other app currently does?

Consider the capabilities of the assistant and how they should be invoked. Skills can range from a simple Q&A chatbot to a complex proactive “entertainment assistant” that suggests TV programs based on your unique schedule and preferences. Your developers might write custom skills for your application, or they might connect to shared skills.

A single assistant might have multiple skills and the appropriate one is invoked depending on the context or the utterance. For example, when a user says “make it warmer, please”  while in the car, the assistant invokes the  “car comfort settings” skill. If the user asks the same question while at home, the assistant invokes a skill for their smart thermostat.

#### Wow: understand what will make your users say "_wow_"
The WOW is up to you to design. Your users will be delighted by an impactful experience that is personalized, proactive, and available across multiple digital or physical forms that they interact with daily.

Another mantra from the field of design is 'crawl, walk, and run'.  Decide what do you need to create and support first and build from there. Keep in mind the big picture experience that you are working towards.
