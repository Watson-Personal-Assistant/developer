Use analytics to gauge how well your assistant is performing and to improve the design of your assistant.

Watson Assistant Solutions provides a Bot Analytics tool in alpha mode for carrying out analysis on data collected.

Data collection for Bot Analytics in enabled by default when your account is provisioned or your trial is enabled.

The Bot Analytics tool stores up to 6 months (180 days) of data.  Metrics are computed daily.

Use the Bot Analytics tool to:

- Monitor performance of your assistant.  For example, view the average confidence scores of your skills to see how well your assistant is responding to requests.
- Understand your users better.  For example, monitor the number of new users accessing your assistant daily.
- Understand the impact that your activities have on the performance of your assistant.  For example, after you introduce a new marketing campaign, see whether new users are attracted to your system.
