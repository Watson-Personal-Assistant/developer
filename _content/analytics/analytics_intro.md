Watson Assistant Solutions provides a Bot Analytics tool in alpha mode for carrying out analysis on data collected.  Data collection for Bot Analytics in enabled by default when your account is provisioned. Metrics are computed nightly at 00:00 GMT.

Use the Bot Analytics tool to:

- Monitor performance of your assistant.  For example, view the average confidence scores of your skills to see how well your assistant is responding to requests.
- Understand your users better.  For example, monitor the number of new users accessing your assistant daily.
- Understand the impact that your activities have on the performance of your assistant.  For example, after you introduce a new marketing campaign, see whether new users are attracted to your system.
- Understand the conversation flow to improve the design of your assistant.  For example, see whether users abruptly abandon the conversation.
