### Filtering pages

You can filter the data on the page to narrow the scope to a skill or intent and to a specific time range. 

#### Setting the scope of the chart

The scope of the data in all of the charts is your Watson Assistant solutions assistant by default. 

With some charts, you can filter the data that is displayed in the graph or bar chart.

- To filter by skill, select a skill from the pull-down menu.<br> ![Setting the time range]({{site.baseurl}}/analytics/users_skill_filter.PNG)
- To filter by intent, select a skill and an intent from the pull-down menu.<br> ![Setting the time range]({{site.baseurl}}/analytics/users_intent_filter.PNG)

**Note**: Filtering is only applied to charts with (Skill, Intent) in their title.

For example:
![Filter in the title]({{site.baseurl}}/analytics/title_filter.PNG)

#### Setting the time range

The default time period for each page is the last 30 days.  Use the slider to increase or decrease the time period. The maximum time period is the last 6 months (180 days).
