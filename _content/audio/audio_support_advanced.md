- Developing a custom audio client:
  You can develop your own audio client using the audio streaming interface definition.  [Set up IAM authentication]({{site.baseurl}}/audio/audio_authentication) for your audio client. To start sending audio to your tenant, you must [establish a web socket connection]({{site.baseurl}}/audio/audio_authentication) from your custom client to the audio gateway.  Use the web socket connect to send [audio streaming messages]({{site.baseurl}}/audio/interface).
